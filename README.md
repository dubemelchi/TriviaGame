# TriviaGame

This is a simple Trivia app that asks 5 true of false questions. You have 10 seconds to complete the trivia(shown by the timer). When ten seconds is up the app will let you know how many questions you got right, wrong and or did not complete.

The project is useful to the user because it allows you to create challenging yet fun entertainment for guests.

Users can get started with the app by simply clicking start. Yep that's it. Just click START button.

Users can get help with the project form Katie and Youseff. I have included their very personal contact details at the end of the quiz. They ask that you contact between 115am and 345am 24/7. 

Mel Dee alone contributes and maintains the project. He's Da Best! NO FURTHER QUESTIONS!
